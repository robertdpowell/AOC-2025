# Write Learning Guide

Create a learning guide that explains the solution logic, algorithms used, and key concepts to help understand and learn from the solution.

## Instructions

1. **Read the following files** in the current day folder:
   - SPECIFICATION.md - to understand the problem
   - solution.py - to understand the implementation
   - test_solution.py - to understand the test cases

2. **Create a new file called LEARNING.md** in the current day folder with the following sections:

## Learning Guide Structure

Replace XX with the actual day number (e.g., 01, 02).

```markdown
# Day XX - Learning Guide

## Problem Summary
A brief summary of what the problem is asking us to solve.

## Key Concepts
List the main programming concepts or techniques used:
- Concept 1 (e.g., parsing, string manipulation)
- Concept 2 (e.g., hash maps, sets)
- etc.

## Algorithm Explanation

### Part One
Step-by-step explanation of how the Part One solution works:
1. First, we...
2. Then, we...
3. Finally, we...

### Part Two
Step-by-step explanation of how the Part Two solution works:
1. First, we...
2. Then, we...
3. Finally, we...

## Code Walkthrough
Highlight important code snippets and explain what they do.

## Time and Space Complexity
- Part One: O(?) time, O(?) space
- Part Two: O(?) time, O(?) space

## What I Learned
Key takeaways and insights from solving this problem.

## Related Topics
Links or references to related algorithms, data structures, or concepts for further learning.
```

3. **Focus on clarity** - write explanations that would help someone new to the problem understand the approach.

4. **Include examples** - use the example inputs/outputs from the specification to illustrate the algorithm steps.
