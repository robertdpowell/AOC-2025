# Writing Learning Guides and Documenting Algorithms

## Introduction
This guide aims to provide instructions for creating effective learning guides and documenting algorithms within the AOC-2025 repository.

## Writing Learning Guides
1. **Define Objectives**: Clearly outline what the reader will learn by the end of the guide.
2. **Structure the Guide**: Divide the content into sections with headings for easy navigation. Use bullet points for key takeaways.
3. **Use Clear Language**: Write in a straightforward manner; avoid jargon unless necessary. Provide explanations when introducing new terms.
4. **Include Examples**: Real-world examples help illustrate concepts. Always provide code snippets where applicable.
5. **Encourage Engagement**: Ask questions to the reader to provoke thought and ensure they understand concepts.

## Documenting Algorithms
1. **Algorithm Overview**: Start with a brief description of the algorithm, including its purpose and use cases.
2. **Step-by-Step Explanation**: Break down the algorithm into understandable parts:
   - **Input**: What inputs does the algorithm accept?
   - **Process**: Describe how the algorithm works step by step.
   - **Output**: Explain what the algorithm returns.
3. **Time and Space Complexity**: Include a section discussing the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of time and storage.
4. **Visual Aids**: Consider adding flowcharts or diagrams for complex algorithms to enhance understanding.
5. **References**: If the algorithm is based on existing work, provide citations. 

By following these guidelines for writing learning guides and documenting algorithms, contributors can enhance the quality and accessibility of project documentation.
