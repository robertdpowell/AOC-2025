# Sample 01 - Past Year Advent of Code Puzzle

### Part One
We have two lists of nummbers
We need to find the smallest number in each list and note the difference between them.
then do the same for the second smallest numbers, and so on until we reach the largest numbers in each list.
Finally, we need to sum all the differences we found.

### Example Input
3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3

### Expected Output (Part One)
2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11

### Part Two
For each number in the first list, count how many times it appears in the second list then multiply that by the number itself. Sum all these products to get the final result.

### Example Input
3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3

### Example Output (Part Two)
31 (9 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 9)
